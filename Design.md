//clubs provides interoperatability between communities, so a yoot can somehow own an apecoin without necessarily buying bayc. Then could have access to share liquidity - through rents of other people's staked NFTs to gain rewards. Although the final view isn't clear yet. Independent arts could also partner, host events. Like granting bayc users special access to mint some art work on their personal marketplace powered by FairWheel. Communities could also function independently has DAOs.. so that addition to teams will now be voted on. Collections now approach clubs to accept them -> they vote -> Fairwheel admins//DAO includes them. Likewise independent artists clubs too. Some certain partnerships starts between them and the clubs. It will connect founders and projects together. We will also grant them IPs to make merchs and sponsor projects by themselves. In competition, they still work together. We develop a whole infra for the communities, they learn to explore, list and buy from themselves on our secondary market which is purely p2p, rent, stake, build on it - the nfts or infra/ecosystem, share through a community showcase stuff, have a dashboard for intra community trades exclusive to fairwheel stuff. We partner with projects to bring out more innovative stuff that the community can take advantage of. At the end of the day, the community in FairWheel will >>>> actual community because of the interoperatability.


#   SECTION DESIGN
Overview
There are 6 Major Labels. Each has its own section that includes group of related traits measured by community importance through bots/AI sizing or by DAO votes. 

Label Headings: Common, Assorted, Rare, SuperRare, Fresh Mint Type A (1/1s, independent art, special editions), Fresh Mint Type B (collections launch).

// claim - teamType, traitType. 
// rand = status off, teamTag(6) AVAILABLE_TEAMS

### Implementation
Tags will be added in frontend. 1 for each claim that defines what you are likely to get, each traits below are sections. Each section will have its own group of traits. Tag headings includes Common, Assorted, Rare, Superrare, Fresh MintA (1/1, independent artist release), Fresh MintB (collections) . All sections will include traits that can be attributed to the heading label.
        
/ rand = 3 // common, assorted, rare, superrare, fresh mintA (1/1s, very little supplies - gold designed), fresh mintB
// onClaim = team C.
